#OF REGARDING ORDINAL FUNCTIONS.


#Python.

# They told me that it was the easiest programming language. Interpreted, dynamic, 
# with simple grammar, of not needing compliation, comprehending by one's own instinction. 
# Yet, they missed out a chunk of scrupulous details that I would love to #go in detail here. 
# By ONE HUNDRED PERCENT CHANCE,if you miss a period, or a dash, or #a bracket, you will receive a LONG message describing which 'fatal' sins you have 
# commited. By ONE HUNDRED PERCENT CHANCE, if you accidentally changed the name of the 
# variable, or worse forgot to name a variable, as your subconsious sincerely hopes 
# that Python would 'automatically' understands it, you will receive a LONG message 
# denoting that your miseries are UNDEFINED. THEY NEVER EXISTED at the first place. BY #ONE HUNDRED PERCENT CHANCE, if you mistyped a variable,
# you will receive A LONG #MESSAGE that THEY DO NOT GO ALONG TOGETHER. 
# These are, in my opinion, the most trival, yet the most NASTY sins one can commit.
# Python, made me consider the matter of life and death, the essence of myself as a minuscule human being at least a thousand times. 
# It made me to perpetually doubt my own ability, whether my brain is properly functioning (I'm quite serious here.) or 
# whether I'd be able to survive in this murky, dubious, labyrinthine world.

#Python also gifted me such voracity, a cataclysmic desire to indulge in everything. I swear, if I weren't anorexic,
#Python would already remain as an inanimate creature. I can now only pray to God, that it gets disspiated by the appropriate preyers.

# YET they told me that it was the easiest programming language.

#YET if I solve this problem in the future, I'd be full of glee, like a five-year-old kid who just received her
# daily dose of candies. Every adversity that I endured so far would disappear.

#That's the only reason that I'm sticking to this language.
